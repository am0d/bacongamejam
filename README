This is a repository holding my work on the BaconGameJam jams.

There will be a separate folder for each jam.

Most of these games will be quite hopeless, but will hopefully get me
into the whole spirit of the game jams!

All code in this repository is released under the MIT license (at the moment,
until I find one I prefer more, or feel the need to change it at all).
