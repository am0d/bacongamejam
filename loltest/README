This is my first game in Lua, and my first (obviously) in Love2D.

Its supposed to be a very simple test to see what the framework is like.

I followed a tutorial I found at http://www.headchant.com/ at first, and
then extended it once I reached the end of that tutorial.

Technically, this is a full game.  It has state management (start screen, playing,
won, lost), it has 3 levels, etc.

Its ugly, but its actually a working game that I have finished, so I'm somewhat
proud of it.
